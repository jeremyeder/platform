# Ambient Code Platform

> Kubernetes-native AI automation platform for intelligent agentic sessions

## Overview

The Ambient Code Platform combines Claude Code CLI with multi-agent collaboration capabilities. Teams create and manage intelligent agentic sessions through a modern web interface, backed by Kubernetes Custom Resources and operators.

### Key Capabilities

- **Intelligent Agentic Sessions**: AI-powered automation for analysis, research, content creation, and development tasks
- **Multi-Agent Workflows**: Specialized AI agents model realistic software team dynamics
- **Git Provider Support**: Native integration with GitHub and GitLab (SaaS and self-hosted)
- **Kubernetes Native**: Custom Resources, Operators, and proper RBAC for enterprise deployment
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live status updates and job execution tracking

## Quick Start

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#local-development-setup) for full local development setup with Kind.

```bash
make kind-up
# Access at http://localhost:8080
```

## Architecture

The platform consists of containerized microservices orchestrated via Kubernetes:

| Component | Technology | Description |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| **Frontend** | NextJS + Shadcn | User interface for managing agentic sessions |
| **Backend API** | Go + Gin | REST API for managing Kubernetes Custom Resources |
| **Operator** | Go | Kubernetes controller that watches CRs and creates Jobs |
| **Runner** | Python + Claude Code CLI | Pod that executes AI with multi-agent collaboration |

```
User Creates Session -> Backend Creates CR -> Operator Spawns Job ->
Pod Runs Claude CLI -> Results Stored in CR -> UI Displays Progress
```

See [docs/internal/architecture/](docs/internal/architecture/) for detailed architecture documentation.
